In order to print microlens with better image quality, we aim to print doublet lens as our final target. However, doublet lens has an overhanging structure and this coudld pontential leads to the writing failure.

For the image above, we exemplify a set of lens we designed for relay system. Our structures are challenging due high-aspect ratio and overhanging structures. Describe software has the ability to correct writing order for different writing blocks to avoid flying writing. However, when overhanging structure exists within the same block, we need further trick to maintain structural integrity.
