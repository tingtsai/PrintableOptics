<h2>Project descriptions</h2>

<p>TThe two-photon polymerization (2PP) technique is based on the interaction of highly localized femtosecond laser radiation with photosensitive material to engineer high fidelity structure with resolution down to 100 nm. 
   Two-photon polymerization is not only cost-effective but also with high resolution and good 3-D structural controllability. 
   Using the Nanoscribe Photonics GT system, we launched a project focusing on miniaturizing micro-optics printing at Stanford.
   The ultimate goal of this study is to produce a cost-effective endoscope engineering for neuroscience applications. 
   As a benchmark, this project showcases the two-photon laser printing of microlens, which is a crucial component for endoscope engineering. </p>
