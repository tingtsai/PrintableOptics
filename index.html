<p>Two-photon polymerization (TPP) is a technique to engineer high fidelity 3D structure with resolution down to 100 nm.
   Based on the interaction of highly localized femtosecond laser radiation with photosensitive material, TPP has become a cost-effective, high resolution, and good 3-D micro/nanoprinting strategy. 
   Using the Nanoscribe Photonics GT system, we launched a project focusing on <a href="https://tingtsai.github.io/PrintableOptics/Introduction">miniaturizing micro-optics printing</a> at Stanford.
   The ultimate goal of this study is to produce a cost-effective endoscope engineering for neuroscience applications. 
   As a benchmark of engineering endoscope, this project showcases the microlens fabrication and identify chanllenges and propose corresponding solutions. 
   We demonstrate a the process flow from design, manufacturing, characterizations, post-processing, and functionalities.
   This project aims to establish a useful and robust workflow for micro-optics fabrication to benefit photonics and micro/nano-fabrication community.
