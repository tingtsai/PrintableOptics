Writing performance can be optimized by using parameters sweep from Describe advanced STL processing. Here, we demonstrate how laser power and scan speed could affect the quality of the microlens writing. Here is an image demonstrated that under 20%, 40%, 60% laser power and 20000, 40000, 60000 um/s scan speed, how these two factors could influence the printed quality. We found that microlens has better surface smoothness with higher laser power and lower scan speed. This results can be explained by the proximity effect for IP-S resin. The proximity effect is more significant when the power is more on a single voxel.
