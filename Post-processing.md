After development of our printed structures, we careful inspect our printed structures and found a intrisic inhomogeneity of exposure exist. This inhomogeneity leads to a grid artifact inside of the structures. Since we speculate this came from the inhomogeneous exposure, we treat the printed structures with UV and in hope to minimize this artifact. The following figure shows our UV treatment is quite effective and it improve the homogeneity of the printed structures.
