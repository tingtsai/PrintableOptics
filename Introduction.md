Lens miniturization is a growing field given its ability to drive revolution in many research areas. For example, the printed micro-optics could integrated with CMOS chip to increase its detection sensitivity. (Image below, left) Simultaneously, microlens could revolutionize neuroscience since minimizing footprint for endoscope is always a critical topic. (Image below, right)

Driven by an idea to produce a better biological probe for neuroscience, we lauch a project in hope to engineer endoscope with small footprint and high bio-compatability. Two-photon polymerization is an ideal technique for us because it is cost-effective and good bio-compatability. 

We also compare current microlens fabrication techniques across various methods, including glass polishing, wet etch molding, thermal reflowing, and meta-lens. Two photon polymerization is the only current technique with the advantage to generate almost arbitratry curvature design. Also, TPP has the potential to assemble many lens together with printing in one shot and this could induce many interesting design for micro-optics such as spectrometer and endoscope.
